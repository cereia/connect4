# connect4

Connect Four is a simple 2 player game where the player drops colored pieces onto the board from above. Players win if they manage to get 4 of their pieces in a consecutive row, column, or along a diagonal.

The goal of this project is to develop a Connect Four game using Test Driven Development (TDD).
